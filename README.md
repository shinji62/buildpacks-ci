# Introduction
Contains pipeline for creating buildpacks

NOT EVERYTHING IS AUTOMATED

# Pipelines

* [binary-builder](pipelines/binary-builders.yml): build binaries for Cloud Foundry buildpacks
* [helper](pipelines/helper-pipelines.yml): Help to generate PHP/PHP7 binary to be build by [binary-builder](pipelines/binary-builders.yml) pipeline.


# Creating Final buildpack

1. You need to tag fork-yahoo branch to the right tag `v*-yahoo` where `*`
is the upstream tag (cloudfoundry)
Better to remove the manifest-yahoo files which is been regenerated by this pipelines
Important DO NOT FORGET to merge upstream to your fork


2. Trigger the job `create-yahoo-manifest`
This will create a `manifest-yahoo.yml` file containing binary generated by our
CI system.


3. Trigger the job `Create-PHP-buildpack`

Normally all binary should be build by the binary-pipeline so the pipeline
will try to find all build binary automatically and create a manifest-yahoo.yml

Pipeline will create a github-releases of the buildpacks


#TBD

Delete manifest-yahoo automatically before creating buildpacks
Ensure automatically that all PHP / PHP7 have been generated.
